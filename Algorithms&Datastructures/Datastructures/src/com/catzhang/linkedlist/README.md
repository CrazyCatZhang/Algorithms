# LinkedList

## 1. Basic Introduction

 - ### The linked list is stored in the form of nodes, which is a chain storage

 - ### Each node contains data field, next field: points to the next node.

 - ### The nodes of the linked list are not necessarily stored continuously.

 - ### The linked list is divided into a linked list with a head node and a linked list without a head node, which is determined according to actual needs

## 2. Type

 - ### [SingleLinkedList](https://github.com/CrazyCatZhang/Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms%26Datastructures/Datastructures/src/com/catzhang/linkedlist/singlelinkedlist)

 - ### [DoubleLinkedList](https://github.com/CrazyCatZhang/Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms%26Datastructures/Datastructures/src/com/catzhang/linkedlist/doublelinkedlist)

 - ### [CirclarLinkedList](https://github.com/CrazyCatZhang/Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms%26Datastructures/Datastructures/src/com/catzhang/linkedlist/josepfu)
