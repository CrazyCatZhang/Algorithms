# Interpolation Search

## 1. Basic Introduction

 - ##### The interpolation search algorithm is similar to binary search, except that the interpolation search starts from the adaptive mid each time

 - ##### The formula for finding the subscript of the central axis is: `int mid = low + (high - low) * (key - arr[low]) / (arr[high] - arr[low])`

## 2. Achieve

 - ##### [Experiment](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/interpolation_search_algorithm.htm)
